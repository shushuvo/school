in this 2nd branch. i added a _redirect file in public directory. react is a single web application freamwork. that's why when anyone try to host multipage react app in a server the other pages doesn't appear. but if you put the _redirect file in the public directory /* /index.html 200 and then build the react app. then put the build folder in a server the multi page react app doesn't cause any problem. this file basically says whatever request come redirect it to the index.html and let the javascript handle the request instead of letting the server to deal with it.
